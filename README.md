### Homework
1. HW01
- part a : Take 4 (x,y) points (y = sin(πx), 0<x<2, choose x values arbitrarily) and find the polynomial that interpolates these points. Add one more point (obeying the above condition) and find the polynomial that interpolates your 5 points.(Choose Handwriting or Word-processing - First part of your report)
- part b : Make your code (any algorithm is okay) to compute integration of y = sin(πx) from 0 to 2 and integration of your interpolation polynomials. Compare your results while increasing the node number for the integration of y = sin(πx). (Second part of your report)
